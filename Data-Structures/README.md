# R Data Structures

## Overview

This directory contains examples and exercises related to core data structures in R. The goal is to help learners understand and implement basic data structures such as vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames in R. These are fundamental concepts for any R programmer.

## Contents

- **01-Vectors/**: Introduction to vectors and basic operations in R.
- **02-Lists/**: Understanding lists and their usage in R.
- **03-Matrices/**: Working with matrices and matrix operations in R.
- **04-Data-Frames/**: Creating and manipulating data frames in R.

## Getting Started

To get started with learning R data structures:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KasrAskari/learn-R-codes.git
   cd learn-R-codes/Data\ Structures
   ```

2. **Explore Each Directory**: Start with basic data structures and move forward as you understand each one.

## Prerequisites

- **R**: Make sure R is installed on your system. You can download it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
- **RStudio** (recommended): RStudio is a powerful IDE for R. Download it from [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
